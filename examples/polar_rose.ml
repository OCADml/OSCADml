(** Define a function that takes a radius [r] and angle [a], and returns a z
    coordinate. This rose function is ported from the examples given in
    the {{:https://github.com/rcolyer/plot-function} plot function} OpenSCAD library. *)

  let x =
    pow
      ( (r *. cos a *. cos (r *. 8. *. pi /. 180.))

(** Starting from the origin, step outward radially with [r_step] increments up
    to a maximal radius of [max_r]. For each of these radii, [rose] will be
    evaluated with angles revolving around the z-axis, evaluating to the height
    off of the XY plane that that position should be. *)

(** As the generated mesh contains quite a large number of points due to the
    relatively low value of [r_step] (megabytes), we'll take advantage of the
   [include] trick provided by the optional [?incl] parameter to
   {{!OSCADml.Scad.to_file} [Scad.to_file]}. This will produce a pair of [.scad]
   scripts, one named ["incl_polar_rose.scad"], and another named
   ["polar_rose.scad"] that simply includes it. By loading the later into
   OpenSCAD rather than the former, we can avoid the sluggishness that can
   result when the editor attempts to handle large files. *)
